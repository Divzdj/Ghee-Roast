# Ghee Roast

Ghee is highly clarified butter and ghee roast is  a dosa that is cooked with ghee or is brushed with melted ghee after it is cooked.
The flavour of this dosa is heightened with a browned, nutty, caramel-like taste and the fragrant aroma that ghee is known for.
However, it is not good for weight watchers.
